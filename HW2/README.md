# Homework 2 – Robotics Course

This homework contains two questions on localization and mapping with the **e-puck** robot.  
Each question includes the problem statement, approach, and the resulting plots.

## Q1 – Pose Estimation (GPS vs Compass vs Encoders)
- **Problem**: At each time step, estimate the robot pose using **GPS**, **Compass**, and **PositionSensor** (encoder-based odometry). Plot the **trajectory (X–Y)** and **heading vs. time (θ–t)** for each method.  
- **Cases**:  
  - Case 1: φ₁ = 1 rad/s, φ₂ = 2 rad/s  
  - Case 2: φ₁ = π rad/s, φ₂ = −π rad/s  
  - Case 3: φ₁(t) = 5 sin t, φ₂(t) = −5 cos t  
- **Goal**: Compare drift/consistency between GPS+Compass and encoder odometry on both **X–Y** and **θ–t**.

## Q2 – Hall Mapping with Split & Merge / IEPF
- **Problem**: In `hall.wbt`, drive the robot in a straight line and use the eight distance sensors (`ds0…ds7`) to sample the environment. Build a 2D point map and post-process it with **Split & Merge** and **IEPF**. Provide a plot **after Split** and another **after Merge**.  
- **Approach**:  
  - **Rotate-scan (start)**: rotate in place, sample every 5°, project returns to world frame using IMU yaw and GPS.  
  - **Straight motion with stop-samples**: move forward at velocity `3.0`, stop every `10` steps, sample all sensors, project to world frame.  
  - **Rotate-scan (end)**: repeat the in-place sampling.  
  - Save points to `Q2/environment_map.csv` with header `x,y,sensor`. Post-process in `Q2/analysis.ipynb` (Split & Merge, IEPF).  
- **Goal**: Produce a clean line-segment map of the hall (preserve walls/corners, reduce over-segmentation).

**Resulting Plots:**
